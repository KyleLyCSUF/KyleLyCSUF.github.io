### CPSC 120

*   Lab 6

        Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites because although I always knew how to play Blackjack, I never knew how to
        program it this way so this project was fun and insightful. This program taught me how to use STOD and STOI in my 
        functions which would later help me when it comes to turning strings into ints or doubles.

*   Lab 7

        Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites because this made me think how the process of programming something so 
        simple was so difficult to implement and translate into code. I learned how to use multiple error if statements 
        which made it easier to identify where my coding errors were. 

*   Lab 3

        Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorites because this allowed me to figure out how C++ syntax worked since I was unfamiliar
        with the language which was very fun. I learned that even though programming can all create somewhat the same programs,
        they require different syntaxes which made all pieces of code from different languages vastly different.
